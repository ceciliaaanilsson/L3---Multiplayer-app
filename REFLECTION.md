## Reflection

### Chapter 2

In the book, the author suggests using searchable names, which I find challenging to implement in a way that’s both descriptive and easily searchable. In my current code, the names I’ve used are quite descriptive, but they may not be very searchable.

As in this code snippet I think that I add meaningful context as both methods have a similar name and also handles different types of messages.

### Chapter 3

![Big function](./images_documentation/long_method.png)
The function from the image shows the handleMovement witch was very long from the start. I have tried to break the method down but this is as small I was able to make it. I broke the method down to 3 methods instead of 1 witch made a big difference. The method updateMovement still has a lot of if-statements. I do think that the first 4 if-statements would be accepteble to have in one method and the other two would be seperated in to different methods.
